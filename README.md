# Solar-Tracking-System

Heliostats are an alternative way to gather the suns energy and convert it to something that we can use. However, each mirror that is used to reflect sunlight requires a minimum of two motors to control the vertical and horizontal movements of the mirror. This requires extra costs including motors, parts, and maintenance.  This study will attempt to demonstrate a way to reduce the cost of a mirror by reducing the need of two motors per mirrors to less than one using an arduino and stepper motors.

This project is to answer a few questions. Namely,
1. Is it feasible to control a horizontal and vertical movement of mirror with less than one motor?
1. Is it feasible to control an array of mirrors with less than one motor?
1. What algorithm would be needed to control an array of mirrors given the suns position?
1. How would you determine the position of the sun without the use of external sensors?
